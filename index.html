                    Rolls Royce is a luxury car and aero engine manufacturer founded by Charles Stuart Rolls and Henry Royce back in 1904. Henry was the brains behind the car making business, and Charles whose interests included flying decided he would try his hand at building aircraft engines.
                    During the First World War, luxury cars were exactly that, a luxury, that only a few people mainly the aristocracy could afford, this together with the bank deciding to withdraw Rolls Royce’s overdraught facility meant they had to concentrate on the aircraft engine side of the business.
                    By the time the Second World War arrived Rolls Royce had a thriving aircraft engine business and gave the world the Merlin which powered the famous Spitfire.
                    After the war and “As the Rolls-Royce organization grew, and expanded through its diverse markets, the value of our famous name and brand was extended. Any activity conducted in the name of Rolls-Royce conformed to a set of values and principles that we hold dear, values that help us to continue to set new standards of excellence”. (Rolls Royce Group PLC, 2010)
                    Rolls Royce hasn’t made luxury cars since 1998 when it sold that part of the business to BMW. Rolls Royce is now a market leader in the production, technological advancement, and environmental control of aircraft engines.
